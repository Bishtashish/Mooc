Random float
100xp

Randomness has many uses in science, art, statistics, cryptography, gaming, gambling, and other fields. You're going to use randomness to simulate a game.

All the functionality you need is contained in the random package, a sub-package of numpy. In this exercise, you'll be using two functions from this package: - seed(): sets the random seed, so that your results are the reproducible between simulations. As an argument, it takes an integer of your choosing. If you call the function, no output will be generated. - rand(): if you don't specify any arguments, it generates a random float between zero and one.
Instructions

    Import numpy as np.
    Use seed() to set the seed; as an argument, pass 123.
    Generate your first random float with rand() and print it out.

Roll the dice
100xp

In the previous exercise, you used rand(), that generates a random float between 0 and 1.

As Filip explained in the video you can just as well use randint(), also a function of the random package, to generate integers randomly. The following call generates the integer 4, 5, 6 or 7 randomly. 8 is not included.

import numpy as np
np.random.randint(4, 8)

Numpy has already been imported as np and a seed has been set. Can you roll some dice?
Instructions

    Use randint() with the appropriate arguments to randomly generate the integer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. This simulates a dice. Print it out.
    Repeat the outcome to see if the second throw is different. Again, print out the result.

Determine your next move

In the Empire State Building bet, your next move depends on the number of eyes you throw with the dice. We can perfectly code this with an if-elif-else construct!

Instructions

    Roll the dice. Use randint() to create the variable dice.
    Finish the if-elif-else construct by replacing ___:
        If dice is 1 or 2, you go one step down.
        if dice is 3, 4 or 5, you go one step up.

The next step
100xp

Before, you have already wrote Python code that determines the next step based on the previous step. Now it's time to put this code inside a for loop so that we can simulate a random walk.
Instructions

    Make a list random_walk that contains the first step, which is the integer 0.
    Finish the for loop:
        The loop should run 100 times.
        On each iteration, set step equal to the last element in the random_walk list. You can use the index -1 for this.
        Next, let the if-elif-else construct update step for you.

How low can you go?
100xp

Things are shaping up nicely! You already have code that calculates your location in the Empire State Building after 100 dice throws. However, there's something we haven't thought about - you can't go below 0!

A typical way to solve problems like this is by using max(). If you pass max() two arguments, the biggest one gets returned. For example, to make sure that a variable x never goes below 10 when you decrease it, you can use:

x = max(10, x - 1)

Instructions

    Use max() in a similar way to make sure that step doesn't go below zero if dice <= 2.

A single random walk is one thing, but that doesn't tell you if you have a good chance at winning the bet.

To get an idea about how big your chances are of reaching 60 steps, you can repeatedly simulate the random walk and collect the results. That's exactly what you'll do in this exercise.

With this neatly written code of yours, changing the number of times the random walk should be simulated is super-easy. You simply update the range() function in the top-level for loop.

There's still something we forgot! You're a bit clumsy and you have a 0.1% chance of falling down. That calls for another random number generation. Basically, you can generate a random float between 0 and 1. If this value is less than or equal to 0.001, you should reset step to 0.

Calculate the odds / Calculer les chances

The histogram of the previous exercise was created from a Numpy array ends, that contains 1,000 integers. Each integer represents the end point of a random walk. To calculate the chance that this end point is greater than or equal to 60, you can count the number of integers in ends that are greater than or equal to 60 and divide that number by 1000, the total number of simulations.

Well then, what's the estimated chance that you'll reach 60 steps high if you play this Empire State Building game? The ends array is everything you need; it's available in your Python session so you can make calculations in the IPython Shell.

Basic while loop
100xp

Below you can find the example from the video where the error variable, initially equal to 50.0, is divided by 4 and printed out on every run:

error = 50.0
while error > 1 :
    error = error / 4
    print(error)

This example will come in handy, because it's time to build a while loop yourself! We're going to code a while loop that implements a very basic control system for a reverted pendulum. If there's an offset from standing perfectly straight, the while loop will incrementally fix this offset.
Instructions

    Create the variable offset with an initial value of 8.
    Code a while loop that keeps running as long as offset is not equal to 0. Inside the while loop:
        Print out the sentence "correcting...".
        Next, decrease the value of offset by 1. You can do this with offset = offset - 1.
        Finally, print out offset so you can see how it changes.

"""
# Initialize offset
offset = 8

    print("correcting...")

The while loop that corrects the offset is a good start, but what if offset is negative? You can try to run the sample code on the right where offset is initialized to -6, but your sessions will be disconnected. The while loop will never stop running, because offset will be further decreased on every run. offset != 0 will never become False and the while loop continues forever.

Fix things by putting an if-else statement inside the while loop.
Instructions

    Inside the while loop, replace offset = offset - 1 by an if-else statement:
        If offset > 0, you should decrease offset by 1.
        Else, you should increase offset by 1.
    If you've coded things correctly, hitting Submit Answer should work this time.

Loop over a list

Have another look at the for loop that Filip showed in the video:

fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
for height in fam : 
    print(height)

As usual, you simply have to indent the code with 4 spaces to tell Python which code should be executed in the for loop.

The areas variable, containing the area of different rooms in your house, is already defined.

Write a for loop that iterates over all elements of the areas list and prints out every element separately.

Indexes and values (1)
100xp

Using a for loop to iterate over a list only gives you access to every list element in each run, one after the other. If you also want to access the index information, so where the list element you're iterating over is located, you can use enumerate().

As an example, have a look at how the for loop from the video was converted:

fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
for index, height in enumerate(fam) :
    print("index " + str(index) + ": " + str(height))

Instructions

Adapt the for loop in the sample code to use enumerate(). On each run, a line of the form "room x: y" should be printed, where x is the index of the list element and y is the actual list element, i.e. the area. Make sure to print out this exact string, with the correct spacing.

If you're dealing with a 2D Numpy array, it's more complicated. A 2D array is built up of multiple 1D arrays. To explicitly iterate over all separate elements of a multi-dimensional array, you'll need this syntax:

Add column (2)
100xp

Using iterrows() to iterate over every observation of a Pandas DataFrame is easy to understand, but not very efficient. On every iteration, you're creating a new Pandas Series.

If you want to add a column to a DataFrame by calling a function on another column, the iterrows() method in combination with a for loop is not the preferred way to go. Instead, you'll want to use apply().

Compare the iterrows() version with the apply() version to get the same result in the brics DataFrame:

for lab, row in brics.iterrows() :
    brics.loc[lab, "name_length"] = len(row["country"])

brics["name_length"] = presidents["country"].apply(len)

We can do a similar thing to call the upper() method on every name in the country column. However, upper() is a method, so we'll need a slightly different approach:
Instructions

    Replace the for loop with a one-liner that uses .apply(str.upper). The call should give the same result: a column COUNTRY should be added to cars, containing an uppercase version of the country names.
    As usual, print out cars to see the fruits of your hard labor

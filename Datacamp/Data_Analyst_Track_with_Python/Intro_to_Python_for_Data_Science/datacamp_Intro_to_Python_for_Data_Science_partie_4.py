Your First Numpy Array

In this chapter, we're going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of Numpy, a powerful package to do data science.

A list baseball has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code here and there to create a Numpy array from it?

Baseball players' height

They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: height. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a Numpy array out of it and convert the units to centimeters?

height is already available and the numpy package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: stat.ucla.edu).

Numpy Side Effects
50xp

As Filip explained before, Numpy is great to do vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

First of all, Numpy arrays cannot contain elements with different types. If you try to build such a list, some of the elments' types are changed to end up with a homogenous list. This is known as type coercion.

Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as +, -, * and / have a different meaning for regular Python lists and Numpy arrays.

Have a look at this line of code:

np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])

Can you tell which code chunk builds the exact same Python object? The Numpy package is already imported as np, so you can start experimenting in the IPython Shell straight away!

You've seen it with your own eyes: Python lists and Numpy arrays sometimes behave differently. Luckily, there are still certainties in this world.

Subsetting 2D Numpy Arrays
100xp

If your 2D Numpy array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements "a" and "c" are extracted from a list of lists.

x = [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
[x[0][0], x[1][0]]

# numpy

For regular Python lists, this is a real pain. For 2D Numpy arrays, however, it's pretty intuitive! The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The : is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.

The code that converts the pre-loaded baseball list to a 2D Numpy array is already in the script. Add some lines to make the correct selections. Remember that in Python, the first element is at index 0!

In the last few exercises you've learned everything there is to know about heights and weights of baseball players. Now it's time to dive into another sport: soccer.

You've contacted the FIFA for some data and they handed you two lists. The lists are the following: positions = ['GK', 'M', 'A', 'D', ...] heights = [191, 184, 185, 180, ...] Each element in the lists corresponds to a player. The first list, positions, contains strings representing each player's position. The possible positions are: 'GK' (goalkeeper), 'M' (midfield), 'A' (attack) and 'D' (defense). The second list, heights, contains integers representing the height of the player in cm. The first player in the lists is a goalkeeper and is pretty tall (191 cm).

You're fairly confident that the median height of goalkeepers is higher than that of other players on the soccer field. Some of your friends don't believe you, so you are determined to show them using the data you received from FIFA and your newly acquired Python skills.
Instructions

    Convert heights and positions, which are regular lists, to numpy arrays. Call them np_heights and np_positions.
    Extract all the heights of the goalkeepers. You can use a little trick here: use np_positions == 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to gk_heights.
    Extract all the heights of the all the other players. This time use np_positions != 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to other_heights.
    Print out the median height of the goalkeepers using np.median(). Replace None with the correct code.
    Do the same for the other players. Print out their median height. Replace None with the correct code.
